This repository contains Supplementary Material (data and source code) to support the paper "Moment-based Density Elicitation with Applications in ProbabilisticLoops" by Andrey Kofnov, Ezio Bartocci and Efstathia Bura. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370103461_Moment-based_Density_Elicitation_with_Applications_in_Probabilistic_Loops.

We propose the K-series estimation approach for the recovery of unknown univariate and multivariate distributions given knowledge of a finite number of their moments. Our method is directly applicable to the probabilistic analysis of systems that can be represented as probabilistic loops; i.e., algorithms that express and implement non-deterministic processes ranging from robotics to macroeconomics and biology to software and cyber-physical systems. K-series statically approximates the joint and marginal distributions of a vector of continuous random variables updated in a probabilistic non-nested loop with nonlinear assignments given a finite number of moments of the unknown density. Moreover, K-series automatically derives the distribution of the systemsâ€™ random variables symbolically as a function of the loop iteration. K-series density estimates are accurate, easy and fast to compute. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach on multiple benchmark examples from the literature.
