##############  DESCRIPTION ################


1) Supplementary Material.pdf - contains theoretical notes, descriptions, benchmarks
2) req.txt - requirements-file for python to execute "main.py"
3) main.py - .py-file with all mathematical logic and with benchmarks
from Table 5 (page 14) of the "Supplementary Material.pdf" and real-data benchmark (see Figure 4 of main paper);
uses "ort_poly2.py" and "Bivariate_normal_distribution.py"
4) ort_poly2.py - python code to carry our Polynomial chaos expansion
5) "Bivariate_normal_distribution.py" - self-written code to implement bivariate normal distribution
6) Figures - folder with plots for benchmarks ( see (3) )
7) S1Dataset.txt - dataset from  Munkhammar et al. [2017]
